# Deep Learning using DeepMatcher

This repository is a supplement resource for a research article entitled ["Deep Learning Untuk Entity Matching Produk Kamera Antar Online Store Menggunakan DeepMatcher"](http://journal.upgris.ac.id/index.php/JIU/article/view/7265). The research is conducting deep learning for entity matching using [DeepMatcher by Anhaidgroup](https://github.com/anhaidgroup/deepmatcher). The test is performed on Google Colaboratory which can be accessed on [this link](https://colab.research.google.com/github/sensasi-delight/deep-learning-using-deepmatcher/blob/main/testing%20code%20for%20DeepMatcher.ipynb).

## Abstract

In Computer Science field, Entity Matching has become a challenge for some researchers. Some have tried to develop an entity matching algorithm to improve accuracy. This study will test [DeepMatcher](https://github.com/anhaidgroup/deepmatcher) as a representation of Entity Matching using Deep Learning by matching entities against case studies of matching camera products at two online stores using four different learning algorithms that [DeepMatcher](https://github.com/anhaidgroup/deepmatcher) has, namely Smooth Inverse Frequency, Bidirectional RNN, Decomposable Attention Model, and Hybrid. Model. By building a dataset and a learning model, [DeepMatcher](https://github.com/anhaidgroup/deepmatcher) can independently match data that has not been previously entered. The matching results will be measured using an f-measure to then analyze its reliability. The test results show that the type of learning on [DeepMatcher](https://github.com/anhaidgroup/deepmatcher) that is most suitable for using in entity matching on camera products between online stores is Bidirectional RNN with an average resulting F1 score of 61.546.
